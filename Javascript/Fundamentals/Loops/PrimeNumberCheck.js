//An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself.
//In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it canâ€™t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.
//For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.
//Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.
//For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.
//P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value.
